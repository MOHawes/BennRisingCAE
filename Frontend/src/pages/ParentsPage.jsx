            We are thrilled you are considering enrolling your child in the{" "}
            <u className="font-semibold">FREE</u> Bennington Rising Program.
            This program was developed to empower youth and local college

            person team including two Bennington College Freshman (Team
            Coordinators). There will be 16 to 20 teams working on projects in
            two areas: What's in your food? & Kids for science!. Your child can
            use the digital platform to read the bios of Team Coordinators and

              Such experience is preferred by colleges and sought by employers
